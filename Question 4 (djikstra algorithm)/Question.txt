There is one spaceship. X and Y coordinate of source of spaceship and destination spaceship is given.
There are N number of wormholes each wormhole has 5 values.
First 2 values are starting co-ordinate of wormhole and after that value no. 3 and 4 represents ending co-ordinate of wormhole
and last 5th value is represents cost to pass through this wormhole.
Now these wormholes are bi-direction.
Now the to go from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) is abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2).
The main problem here is to find minimum distance to reach spaceship from source to destination co-ordinate using any number of warm-hole.
It is ok if you wont use any wormhole.
Hint:
You can make graph which contain edge between all points and put cost of that edge.
Now apply djikstra algorithm to find minimum distance between source to destination co-ordinate of spaceship.
Here the main catch is that the cost to pass through wormhole can be zero so you have to take care while making graph matrix.
5     // Number of test cases

0     // number of worm holes
0 0 60 60 // co-ordinates of start and end points.

1			// number of worm holes
0 0 2 0		// co-ordinates of start and end points.
1 0 1 2 0   // Co-ordinates of entry/exit and exit/entry with time taken to travel through the worm hole.
