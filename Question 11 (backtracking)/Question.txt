Fishing Spots: 1 to N 3 Gates with gate position and number of fishermen waiting to get in Distance between consecutive spots = distance between gate and nearest spot = 1 m. 
Fishermen are waiting at the gates to get in and occupy nearest fishing spot. Only 1 gate can be opened at a time and all fishermen of that gate must occupy spots before next 
gate is open. There could be 2 spots closest to the gate. Assign only 1 spot to the last fisherman in such a way that we get minimum walking distance. For rest of the fishermen, 
ignore and assign any one. Write a program to return sum of minimum distance need to walk for fishermen. Note : The problem can be solved using Recursion and Backtracking by 
considering all possible combinations.
